# Release Notes v1.0.0: Anti-Serverless Monorepo

We are excited to announce the first release of the **Anti-Serverless Monorepo**, a high-performance, production-ready foundation for serverless web applications.

## Key Features

### 🏗️ Monorepo Architecture
- Managed with **pnpm workspaces**.
- Unified codebase for Infrastructure, API, and Frontend.

### 🚀 High-Performance API
- Built with **Hono** on Node.js.
- **Dependency Injection** for clean, testable code.
- **Zod** schema validation for type-safe inputs.
- Supports **Dual-Repository Pattern**:
    - `InMemoryTaskRepository` for fast local development.
    - `DynamoDBTaskRepository` for production scalability.

### 💻 Modern Frontend
- Built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Real-time interaction with the API.
- **Dual-Write Synchronization**: Automatically creates tasks in both Local and Production environments simultaneously to keep data in sync.

### ☁️ Infrastructure as Code
- Fully defined using **AWS CDK** in TypeScript.
- **Single-Table Design** DynamoDB for efficiency.
- **AWS Lambda** & **API Gateway v2** for serverless scale.
